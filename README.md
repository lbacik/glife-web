# GLife-Web

This project is a web implementation of Conway's Game of Life.

Repository: [https://github.com/lbacik/glife-web](https://github.com/lbacik/glife-web)

It is fully functional as a standalone project; however, in a broader context, its purpose is to be part 
of the test suite for the genetic algorithm library called [genes](https://github.com/lbacik/genes).

<p class="warning">
    Right now the whole idea is in a very early stage of development.
